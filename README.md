# NoSQL-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 12 HW on NoSQL Databases
This homework was a challenge to analyze restaurant ratings using a NoSQL database, pandas, and aggregation. I used the XpertLearner and some of my professor's code to supplement my own.  My answers look different than the examples in the challenge instructions. 

I found that there were more zero rated establishments than there were 5 rated of the many in the area of featured new restaurant. I was somewhat shocked at that.
